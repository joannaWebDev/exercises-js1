/*
Design and create a function that:
takes in more than one input
uses string concatenation
this means adding two strings together
performs some form of operation on a number
uses return to return a string
Add a comment above your function to explain what it does
Call your function and run your script
What's the difference between a return and console.log?
When would you choose to use functions over the way we have been scripting so far?*/
